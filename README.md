1. To save text one 1 of 2 commands can be used.
```
 -a or -add
```
3. Next we can type our text and hit enter to save.
```
The above step combined will look something like this.
**node . -a 'Save some text'**
```
```
- node . we can type -a followed by a string to 'add' a string.(Ex: node . -a 'some words')
